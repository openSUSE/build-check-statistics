samba-libs.x86_64: I: binary-or-shlib-calls-gethostbyname /usr/lib64/samba/libsamba-sockets-samba4.so
The binary calls gethostbyname(). Please port the code to use getaddrinfo().

samba-libs.x86_64: W: call-to-mktemp /usr/lib64/samba/libkrb5samba-samba4.so
This executable calls mktemp. As advised by the manpage (mktemp(3)), this
function should be avoided. Some implementations are deeply insecure, and
there is a race condition between the time of check and time of use (TOCTOU).
See http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/29.html for details, and contact
upstream to have this issue fixed.

This filename is too long to fit on a joliet filesystem (limit is 64 unicode
chars).

samba.src:1265: W: macro-in-comment %{DOCDIR}
There is a unescaped macro after a shell style comment in the specfile. Macros
are expanded everywhere, so check if it can cause a problem in this case and
escape the macro with another leading % if appropriate.

samba-libs.x86_64: W: missing-call-to-chdir-with-chroot /usr/lib64/samba/libsmbd-base-samba4.so
This executable appears to call chroot without using chdir to change the
current directory. This is likely an error and permits an attacker to break
out of the chroot by using fchdir. While that's not always a security issue,
this has to be checked.

This script uses 'env' as an interpreter. For the rpm runtime dependency
detection to work, the shebang #!/usr/bin/env python  needs to be patched into
#!/usr/bin/python  otherwise the package dependency generator merely adds a
dependency on /usr/bin/env rather than the actual interpreter /usr/bin/python.
